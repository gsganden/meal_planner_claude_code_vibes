# Database Isolation Fix Summary

## Problem
Tests were failing due to database isolation issues where tests shared database state, causing "email already exists" errors and other conflicts.

## Root Causes
1. **Global database state**: The `src/db/database.py` module used global variables for engine and session_maker
2. **Inconsistent test fixtures**: Each test file had its own database setup approach
3. **No proper cleanup**: Database connections weren't properly disposed between tests
4. **Shared database files**: Some tests might have been using the same database file

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Centralized Test Fixtures (`tests/conftest.py`)
- Created a centralized `test_client` fixture that:
  - Creates a unique temporary database file for each test
  - Creates its own engine and session_maker (not using globals)
  - Properly overrides the `get_db` dependency
  - Ensures complete cleanup after each test
  - Disables connection pooling for tests

- Added `authenticated_client` fixture that builds on `test_client` to provide:
  - Pre-authenticated client with unique user email
  - Ready-to-use auth token in headers

- Added `test_db_session` fixture for direct database access in tests

### 2. Updated Test Files
- **`tests/test_auth.py`**: Now uses centralized `test_client` fixture
- **`tests/test_database.py`**: Now uses centralized `test_db_session` fixture  
- **`tests/test_recipes.py`**: Now uses centralized `authenticated_client` fixture
- **`tests/test_integration.py`**: Updated to use centralized fixtures
- **`tests/test_rate_limiting.py`**: Updated to use centralized fixtures
- **`tests/test_websocket.py`**: Updated with proper isolation (kept TestClient for WebSocket support)

### 3. Key Changes to Database Isolation
- Each test gets its own SQLite database file
- Database engine and session are created per-test, not globally
- Proper cleanup ensures no state leakage between tests
- Connection pooling disabled to prevent connection reuse issues

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, you need to:

1. Set up a Python virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run specific test files:
```bash
# Run auth tests
python -m pytest tests/test_auth.py -v

# Run database tests  
python -m pytest tests/test_database.py -v

# Run recipe tests
python -m pytest tests/test_recipes.py -v

# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## Verification

The database isolation is working correctly when:
1. No "email already exists" errors occur when running tests
2. Tests can be run in any order without failures
3. Running tests multiple times produces consistent results
4. Each test starts with a clean database state

## Additional Notes

- The `TESTING` environment variable is set to disable rate limiting in tests
- Each test uses a unique temporary file in the system's temp directory
- WebSocket tests use FastAPI's TestClient (not httpx.AsyncClient) for WebSocket support
- All database operations are properly isolated within each test's transaction scope
